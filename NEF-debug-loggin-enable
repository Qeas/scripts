echo development >/etc/nef/environment


and then just restart nef with svcadm. It should say in the begining something like:

[09:42:29.425] [         core] [ info] Starting NEF in development environment

in logs.

To reset back just remove this file and restart again.



There is a way to temporary set debug/trace logging for any particular worker even without restart:

bin/nefclient sysconfig setLoggerLevel '{level: "debug"}'
It should work until next restart/reboot

echo development >/etc/nef/environment
nefclient sysconfig setProperty  '{id: "worker.rest.traceRequests", value: true, persistent: true}'
or
/usr/nef/bin/nefclient sysconfig setProperty  '{id: "worker.rest.traceRequests", value: true, persistent: true}'
svcadm restart nef

rm /etc/nef/environment
svcadm restart nef
